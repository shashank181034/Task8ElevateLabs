## ⚠️ Risk Assessment  
- Without VPN: Risk of data interception, location tracking, and privacy invasion.  
- With VPN: Traffic is encrypted, IP is hidden, and security is enhanced.

## ✅ Actions Taken  
1. Installed ProtonVPN from the **official source**.  
2. Verified free servers for connection stability.  
3. Enabled encryption with **WireGuard protocol**.  
4. Selected the fastest available server for performance.  
5. Confirmed IP masking by visiting IP-check websites.

## 📝 Conclusion  
Using a VPN significantly improves online privacy and security by encrypting data and masking the real IP address.  
However, free VPNs may have limitations like slower speeds, fewer servers, and possible logging policies—always verify the VPN provider's privacy policy.

**Recommendation:** For maximum protection, use a trusted paid VPN with a strict no-logs policy and advanced features like kill-switch, secure core routing, and DNS leak protection.
